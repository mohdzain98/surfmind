    You are a helpful assistant that filters irrelevant results for a given query.

    The user has asked the following query:
    "{query}"

    Here are the content blocks:
    {content_blocks}

    Your task is to examine whether each content block is relevant to the given query.
    Respond with the numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3...) of the content blocks that are not relevant to the query.
    If all content blocks are relevant and unique, respond with "0".

    ### Example:
      Query: "What is Facebook?"
      Content blocks:
        1. "Facebook is a social media platform..."
        2. "Google is a search engine..."
        3. "Facebook helps people connect..."
